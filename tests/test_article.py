"""The article reader's address check, which is the whole security story.

The reader takes a story id and looks the URL up, so the obvious attack —
handing it an address — is already closed. What is left is subtler and is
what this file is about: the URL comes from a third-party news feed, and
the server on the other end of it gets to answer "go and fetch this other
address instead". A check that only inspects the address you started with
is not a check at all under those conditions.

No network. Address literals are used everywhere a public host is needed,
so nothing here depends on DNS, and the one unresolvable case uses .invalid
(RFC 2606), which is guaranteed never to resolve.
