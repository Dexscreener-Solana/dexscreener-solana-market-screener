"""PyInstaller spec for QuantPilot.

    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller QuantPilot.spec

Produces dist/QuantPilot.exe — a single windowed binary with the web UI
and the icon bundled in.

Two things worth knowing:

  - `--windowed` means no console. The terminal lives in the tray and the
    browser, so a console window would only ever be in the way. It also
    means print() goes nowhere: anything the user must see has to reach
    the UI.
  - yfinance pulls in a lot transitively, and PyInstaller's analysis
    misses the protobuf message classes that the websocket decoder builds
    at import time. They are named explicitly below; without them the exe
    runs but never receives a tick, which looks exactly like a quiet
    market.
