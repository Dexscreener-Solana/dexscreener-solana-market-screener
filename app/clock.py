"""Keeping the snapshot fresh.

Two jobs, both driven by the exchange rather than by a calendar:

  - **Rebuild** the whole universe on session transitions (open, mid,
    close). Reading the venue's own `marketState` gets market holidays and
    half-days right for free — no transition fires on a day the exchange
    is shut, and no holiday table has to be maintained and then quietly
    rot.

  - **Roll** through the universe re-quoting it between rebuilds, so the
    snapshot never drifts far from the tape. A full rebuild also refetches
    the Nasdaq listing and rewrites a generation; a roll only refreshes
    prices, which is all that moves intraday.

Everything here is best-effort. A failed refresh is reported and retried
next tick; it never takes the terminal down, because a stale screener you
can still use beats a dead one.
