"""Local HTTP + SSE server for the terminal (stdlib http.server).

Binds 127.0.0.1 — this is a personal terminal, not a service. Same shape
as the OfflinePilotX cockpit: a per-launch token injected into the served
page and echoed on every API call, plus a loopback Host check, so no other
website can drive the API through the browser.

The two clocks the UI runs on:
  /api/screen   filters the local snapshot   — no network, unmetered
  /api/quotes   refreshes the visible rows   — 1-3 upstream calls per tick

Everything slow (a universe rebuild) happens on a worker thread and
reports over /api/events, so the terminal is usable while it runs.
