"""Live US finance television, as a wall of embedded streams.

The financial networks run their broadcast on YouTube around the clock, and
the embed is the sanctioned way to watch it: `oembed` says yes for every
channel below, so nothing here rips a stream or works around a player.

What this module does *not* do is read the audio. YouTube renders live
captions inside its own player but exposes no retrievable track — the watch
page carries no `captionTracks` for a live video, the innertube player
returns an empty caption list, and `timedtext` answers 200 with zero bytes.
Their own documentation puts a downloadable transcript 12-24 hours after the
broadcast ends, and `captions.download` needs OAuth as the channel owner.
So the terminal does not pretend to know what is being said. It shows what
is being *traded* alongside the picture, which it can establish honestly
from the snapshot it already holds.

Liveness is read from the channel's own `/live` page rather than the Data
API, because the API would mean a key, and a key would mean the front page
stops being able to say there isn't one.
