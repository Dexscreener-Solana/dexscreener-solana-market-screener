"""The screening engine — text expression -> boolean mask over the universe.

`store.screens` has always stored a text `expr`; this is the thing that
evaluates it. Two callers, one mechanism: the command line passes an
expression the user typed, and the Finviz-style dropdown bar compiles its
state down to the same string via `filters_to_expr()`. So anything the
dropdowns can express is saveable, and anything saved can be typed.

Expressions are parsed with `ast` and walked under an allowlist. `eval()`
is never called on user text and neither is `DataFrame.query`, which
executes attribute access and would happily run `@__import__`. A rejected
expression names the token that killed it:

    mcap > 10b and chg > 3 and relvol > 2
    sector == "Technology" and pe < 25 and from52high > -5
    2 < pe < 30 and price / sma50 > 1.05
