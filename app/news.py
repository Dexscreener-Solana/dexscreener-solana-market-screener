"""The market news feed, and what makes a story hot.

Two sources, because neither is sufficient alone:

  - Yahoo's top-stories RSS is broad and fast (45 items, ~0.3s) but
    carries **no tickers at all** — checked, not assumed. Good for market
    context, useless for "what is moving".
  - The search endpoint returns `relatedTickers`, so news can be attached
    to companies — but only one symbol per request.

So the feed queries news for the day's biggest movers and merges it with
the broad wire. Which symbols to ask about is the interesting part, and
it is free: the snapshot already knows exactly what is moving.

**Hotness** is scored rather than assumed from recency alone. A story is
hot when it is recent *and* about something that is actually moving. A
40-minute-old piece on a stock down 16% outranks a five-minute-old
opinion column, and a roundup tagged with eight tickers is discounted
because it is not really news about any of them.
